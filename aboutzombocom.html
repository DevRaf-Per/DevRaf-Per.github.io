    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Zombo.com is a single-serving site created in 1999. It was originally a faculty and student joke from the George Washington University Center for Professional Development. The site parodies Flash introductory web pages that play while the rest of a site's content loads. Zombo took the concept to a humorous extreme, consisting of one long introductory page that leads to an invitation to sign up for a newsletter.

        The site was initially a Flash animation, but as of 5 January 2021, the website now uses HTML5 instead due to Adobe Flash Player being discontinued.
